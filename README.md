Google Maps Engine Connector for ArcGIS
=====================================

**Note:** The Google Maps Engine API is deprecated. Support for the 
Google Maps Engine (GME) product ends on January 29th, 2016. You can 
use your existing GME project as well as the GME API until that date. 
After January 29th, 2016, GME will be deactivated and the API will 
therefore no longer be available.
